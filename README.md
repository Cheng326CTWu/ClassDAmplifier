# Discrete Components Class D Amplifier
## Overview

This project is intended to flesh out understanding of class D power amplifier concepts which was taught in my university's
Integrated Analog Circuits and RFIC Circuits course. There will be a more detailed guide detailing the process which was undertaken
in the development of this project down below.

## Software Requirement

Below are softwares used for the completion of this project:

* Altium Designer
* LTSpice

## Hardware Equipment (Not Board Components!)

Below are some equipment which will be needed for the completion of this project:

* Benchtop Power Supply - Ideally 0-30V 0-5A
* Oscilloscope
* Multimeter
* Soldering Iron
* Electronics Hot Air Gun (Applicability TBD)
* Breadboard/Prototype board

**NOTE:** BOM will be listed below
